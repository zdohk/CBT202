  THIS FILE IS TO DEMONSTRATE THE EXTRA REPORTING OF I/O ACTIVITY
  AVAILABLE FROM CBT FILE 134.

  MEMBER -JOBMESGS- IS THE JOB MESSAGES DATA SET FROM AN SMP/E
  RECEIVE BATCH JOB.  THE MESSAGES WITH IDENTIFIERS BEGINNING
  WITH 'U83' WERE PRODUCED BY AN 'IEFU83' EXIT FROM CBT FILE 134.
  FULL DETAILS ARE IN MEMBER '$$IEFU83' OF CBT FILE 134.
  A READY-TO-USE LOAD MODULE OF 'IEFU83' IS IN CBT FILE 135.

  MEMBER -SMFRECS- CONTAINS SOME SMF RECORDS GENERATED BY THE SAME
  BATCH JOB.  BROWSE THIS MEMBER WITH THE 'REVIEW' COMMAND.
  (REVIEW LOAD MODULES ARE SUPPLIED IN CBT FILE 135.)
  ISSUE "SMF ON" AND THEN SCROLL RIGHT ONE PAGE AT A TIME.
  NOTE THAT THE EXCP DD SECTIONS CONTAIN THE EXCP COUNT AND THE
  CONNECT TIME.  SEE HOW EVEN SYSOUT DATA SETS HAVE AN I/O COUNT
  AND A BLOCK SIZE VALUE.  (THE I/O COUNT IS REALLY THE PRINT LINE
  COUNT HERE.)  THE DATA FOR SYSOUT DATA SETS WAS SUPPLIED BY THE
  'JESIOSVC' SVC ROUTINE FROM CBT FILE 134.  THE SVC ROUTINE IS
  CALLED FROM IGG019DJ (QSAM) AND IGG019DK (BSAM).  FULL DETAILS
  ARE IN MEMBER '$SP4MODS' OF CBT FILE 134.
